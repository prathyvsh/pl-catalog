"A TypeScript-like language for WebAssembly."

AssemblyScript inherits basic TypeScript syntax but leaves out all of complex type features. On the other hand AssemblyScript type system is completely mandatory and strict (no Any or Unknown types) thus guiding compiler optimizations. Speaking of which, AssemblyScript employs [[http://webassembly.github.io/binaryen/][Binaryen]] as a compiler back-end implementing its own specific optimizations on top of it. In addition to that it features three options for a run-time system ranging from no run-time at all with completely manual memory management to an advanced GC that still supports manual triggering. Not mentioning hand-crafted standard library implementing state-of-the-art numerical and sorting algorithms. :)

Passerine is a small extensible programming language designed for concise expression with little code. Passerine has roots in Scheme and ML-flavored languages: at its core, it's lambda-calculus with pattern-matching, structural ADTs, effect-based concurrency, and syntactic extension. The goal of Passerine is to create a tiny language core that can be extended in a composable manner, for use as a functional scripting language embeddable in other applications. Currently in early stages of development, Passerine has a 3 compilers at varying stages of completeness: one written in Rust, another D, and one in Passerine itself. It can target Wasm, its own compact bytecode format, D-lang, JS, and native code, among other formats.
